# Introduction

Firewalls are perhaps one of the most essential tools for any cyber security practitioner. With them, you can sort through large amounts of information and, if set up properly, can significantly reduce the vulnerabilities your network has to cyberattacks. However, they can be quite complicated to use in terms of configuration, and even more so when you do not fully understand the topology of your network. The objectives of this lab are to better acquaint me with the concepts of network topology and how machines in a network send information to one another and how to properly set up firewalls so that I can reduce risks, modify permissions, and gather relevant information more efficiently.
